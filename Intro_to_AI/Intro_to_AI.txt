WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)->
//      Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the technology that allows machines
//        and computers to replicate human intelligence

// Used in various professions 
-> Healthcare     =  diagnosing diseases
-> finance        = fraud detection
-> e-commerce     = personalized recommendations
-> transportation = self-driving cars ... etc


//   foundational concepts

1. MACHINE LEARNING (ML)
It focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data.
-> Identify patterns within data
-> Improve its performance over time without human intervention

2. GENERATIVE AI 
It Created new data/content like-> Text,images.music or even videos Unlike  traditional AI that simply analyzes data. Basically it "CREATES" rather than just "RECOGNIZE"

---> How Generative AI works
    breakdown of how it works:
      > Uses Complex Algorithms

      > Trained on Large datasets
      /*
                  //  which could include anything from text (like books or articles) to images or even music.
                  //  During the training process, the AI learns the relationships and patterns in the data
      */

      > Neural Networks and Deep learning
      /*
            // It mimics the Human brain , how it process the information
            // Deep Neural Networks Consist of Multiple Layers
            // using the layers to process the input data in stages to detect patterns and learn complexities
      */

      > Creating new Content
      /*
          // Once trained, the AI can generate new content by sampling from the learned patterns
      Example- 
              >  Predicting the next word or phrase based on previous text
              >  Image generation could involve creating entirely new visuals based on learned data
      */

      > Feedback LOOP and refinement
            // Generative AI often works in a feedback loop, where it refines its creations through multiple iterations



3.NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING(NLP)
It is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and interact with human language in a way that feels natura

**NLP involves a combination of linguistics (the study of language) and computer science to process and analyze human language.
        // It includes tasks like language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots.

4. EXPERT SYSTEMS
They are a type of artificial intelligence designed to replicate the decision-making ability of a human expert in a specific field.        
-> Uses a combination of stored knowledge
-> And logical reasoning
-> Predefined "If-then" rules

AI MODELS
/*
  AI models are computer programs that learn to perform tasks by recognizing patterns in data, similar to how our brains learn from experience. They are trained on large datasets and then use what they’ve learned to make decisions, whether it’s identifying faces in a photo, translating languages or generating text.    
*/
AI models can be categorized based on their learning approach:
    1. Supervised Learning 
      //like image classification, speech recognition and spam detection.
    2. Unsupervised Learning
      //like customer segmentation and anomaly detection.
    3. Reinforcement Learning 
      //like game playing and robotic control.
